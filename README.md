# Adjust Web App Deployment on Kubernetes
This repository basically helps you to deploy an App written in Ruby to recieve and serve http requests on kubernetes. We use the minukube tool to deploy and test the application. Minikube is a tool that helps us to run the kubernetes cluster on the local machine. It's a single node kubernetes cluster that helps the local development of applications and k8 objects.

# Overview
The App which is written in Ruby will create a web server that listens to a specified port and serve the requests coming to it depends on the routing added to the application. The App here is a containerized one and it would listen to the port 80 in the container, when the path http://hostname:30001/ is requested. Note that the URL changes depends how we expose the app to the outside world or within kubernetes itself.

#Technologies
*minikube version v1.19.0
*Helm version v3.5.4
*Docker engine version 20.10.5-ce
*ruby version 3.0.1p64
*Ansible 2.10.9

#Prerequisites
In order to run and test the App on your local machine we need the below tools installed on your local machine depends on your Operating System flavor.

1. Install VirtualBox on your local machine which is necessary for running minikube, for apple silicon machines VirtualBox is not supported at the moment and you can use docker as minikube driver. feel free to skip the steps if you are already having minikube instaleld and running. Refer the link below for VirtualBox downloads: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2. Download and install docker desktop as we are using docker environment set up to run k8s and test the application, follow the link below for the same. https://docs.docker.com/desktop/

3. Download and install the Ansible for running playbook automation. follow the link for ansible installtion https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html

4. Download and install helm which is a package manager for k8s and helps to make the deployment of apps on kubernetes easy. Install helm from the below link. https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

#Installation
The repository contains all the necessary app files, kubernetes manisfests, helmcharts and Dockerfile to make the deployment easy. The Dockerfile will build and package the application will give us the required docker image to run on kubernetes. It's a multi stage Dockerfile which actually reduces the complexity and size of the final image.
Ansible playbook is used for onestep installtion method for docker building and helm chart installing. Follow the steps below to run the app on kubernetes environment powered by minikube.

1. Open the terminal and run the below command to clone the repository to the local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/liphinstanley/Adjust.git
```
2. Start the minikube service on the local machine using the Virtualbox as driver. The command may change according to the flavor of your operating system. (This commands were tested using a Mac M1 silicon machine at the time of development)
```
minikube start ‚Äî driver=docker
```
3. Run the below command so that the minikube will be able to use the Docker daemon inside the minikube instance. This is required because we are using all development operations locally and this enables to load the docker image from the local machine itself. The imagePullPolicy: Never in the deployment manifest of App triggers the same.
```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```
4. Install the app using the below Ansible command from /Adjust
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml --connection=local
```
The web-app is exposed as a NodePort service so that we can access it from the local machine, using command line or using web browser. The following command will give you the URL that the service is exposed to:
```
minikube service web-app --url
```
According to the app, the route hostname/healthcheck will return "OK" result and hostname/ will return "Well, hello there!" Use the command below to test the application using a curl command.
```
curl http://<host-IP-address>:nodePort/healthcheck
curl http://<host-IP-address>:nodePort/
```
The desired output is shown below,
 ```
 ‚ùØ kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```
Since the test minikube M1 silicon has networking limitations of driver docker on darwin OS, ingress addon is not supported. nodePort 30001 is enabled but ingress wasn't able to test.
